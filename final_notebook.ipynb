    "For this project I will be using two different tables of data. The first will be inpatient charges which contains the locaion of a hospital, the service provided to the paitient, and finally the average cost for the service. The second is Hospital General information which contains the location of a hospital and then ratings for different services they provide. For classification, I will be developing models to predict the region in which a certain hospital resides. This model will be trained using both continous and categorical data. The categorical data will include the Hospital;s overall rating, name, and ownership. The continous data will be the average total amount of money patients paid when visiting. This will be calculated by finding the mean of the payements for each of the hospitals intances in the dataset, ignoring which service the individual patient paid for "
