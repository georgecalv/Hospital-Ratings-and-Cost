The second is Hospital General information which contains the location of a hospital and then ratings for different services they provide. For classification, based I can predict the certain hospital a paitent went to based on the price they paid for their service, the location of the patient, and the overall ratings of the hospitals (assuming that a patient has chosen to go to the best rated hospuital for their service)"
